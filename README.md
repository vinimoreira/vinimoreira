# 👋 Hello, I'm Vinícius Moreira

🎯 Fullstack Software Engineer | Solutions Architect | Tech Leader

💡 With over 12 years of experience in software development, I specialize in building scalable, maintainable, and resilient systems. I’m passionate about **clean architecture**, **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**, and **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** practices. I enjoy working with technologies like **C#**, **.NET Core**, **React**, and **AWS**, often mixing backend reliability with elegant frontend experiences.

🏗️ **Solutions Architect Side**
As a **Solutions Architect**, I lead the design of modern, event-driven, and cloud-native systems. My architectural work is grounded in:

- 📐 Clean Architecture & Hexagonal Architecture
- 🧩 Microservices & Integration Patterns (Service Bus, Webhooks, APIs)
- 🔍 Observability-first mindset using **OpenTelemetry** and **Datadog**
- 🔐 Secure, scalable identity flows (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, Cognito, Azure AD)
- 🔄 Automation of deployment pipelines and incident response workflows
- 👥 Mentorship of development teams, aligning code to business strategy

I focus not just on the “how” but also the “why”, driving alignment between technical decisions and product goals. My work often involves prototyping, conducting architecture reviews, and translating requirements into practical, efficient solutions.

🌎 I'm looking for international opportunities that allow me to grow professionally and improve my English skills.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools I work with:
- 🖥️ Backend: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, REST APIs
- 🧠 Architecture: DDD, Event-Driven Systems, Clean Architecture, CQRS
- ☁️ Cloud: AWS (Cognito, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, S3, ECS, EC2,Lambda Functions), Azure (AD, Service Bus, APP Insigths)
